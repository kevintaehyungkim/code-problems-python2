### FIND MEDIAN FROM DATA STREAM ###
####################################
'''
Median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. 
If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value. 
So the median is the mean of the two middle value.

For example,
[2,3,4], the median is 3

[2,3], the median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5

Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

void addNum(int num) - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
double findMedian() - Return the median of all elements so far.
 

Example:

addNum(1)
addNum(2)
findMedian() -> 1.5
addNum(3) 
findMedian() -> 2

### LOG STORAGE SYSTEM ###
##########################
'''
You are given several logs that each log contains a unique id and timestamp. 
Timestamp is a string that has the following format: Year:Month:Day:Hour:Minute:Second, for example, 2017:01:01:23:59:59. All domains are zero-padded decimal numbers.

Design a log storage system to implement the following functions:

void Put(int id, string timestamp): Given a log's unique id and timestamp, store the log in your storage system.
int[] Retrieve(String start, String end, String granularity): 
	Return the id of logs whose timestamps are within the range from start to end. 
	Start and end all have the same format as timestamp. 

Example 1:
put(1, "2017:01:01:23:59:59");
put(2, "2017:01:01:22:59:59");
put(3, "2016:01:01:00:00:00");
retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01","2017:01:01:23:00:00","Year"); // return [1,2,3]
retrieve("2016:01:01:01:01:01","2017:01:01:23:00:00","Hour"); // return [1,2]

### SEARCH AUTOCOMPLETE SYSTEM ###
##################################
'''
Design a search autocomplete system for a search engine. 
Users may input a sentence (at least one word and end with a special character '#'). 
For each character they type except '#', you need to return the top 3 historical hot sentences 
that have prefix the same as the part of sentence already typed. 

Example:
Operation: AutocompleteSystem(["i love you", "island","ironman", "i love leetcode"], [5,3,2,2])

The system have already tracked down the following sentences and their corresponding times:
"i love you" : 5 times
"island" : 3 times
"ironman" : 2 times
"i love leetcode" : 2 times

Now, the user begins another search:

Operation: input('i')
Output: ["i love you", "island","i love leetcode"]

Operation: input(' ')
Output: ["i love you","i love leetcode"]

Operation: input('a')
Output: []

Operation: input('#')
Output: []

### INTUIT - SHARED COURSES ###

'''
You are a developer for a university. 
Your current project is to develop a system for students to find courses they share with friends. 
The university has a system for querying courses students are enrolled in, 
returned as a list of (ID, course) pairs.

Write a function that takes in a list of (student ID number, course name) pairs and returns, 
for every pair of students, a list of all courses they share.

Sample Input:
student_course_pairs = [
    ["58", "Software Design"],
    ["58", "Linear Algebra"],
    ["94", "Art History"],
    ["94", "Operating Systems"],
    ["17", "Software Design"],
    ["58", "Mechanics"],
    ["58", "Economics"],
    ["17", "Linear Algebra"],
    ["17", "Political Science"],
    ["94", "Economics"]
]

Sample Output (pseudocode, in any order)

find_pairs(student_course_pairs) =>
{
    [58, 17]: ["Software Design", "Linear Algebra"]
    [58, 94]: ["Economics"]
    [17, 94]: []
