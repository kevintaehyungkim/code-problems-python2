Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in S such that a + b + c = 0? 
Find all unique triplets in the array which gives the sum of zero.

For example, given array S = [-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4],
A solution set is:
[
  [-1, 0, 1],
  [-1, -1, 2]

### FROG JUMP - TIKTOK ###
##########################
'''
A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into x units and at each unit there may or may not exist a stone. 
The frog can jump on a stone, but it must not jump into the water.

Given a list of stones' positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, 
determine if the frog is able to cross the river by landing on the last stone. 
Initially, the frog is on the first stone and assume the first jump must be 1 unit.

If the frog's last jump was k units, then its next jump must be either k - 1, k, or k + 1 units. 
Note that the frog can only jump in the forward direction.

Note:

The number of stones is ≥ 2 and is < 1,100.
Each stone's position will be a non-negative integer < 231.
The first stone's position is always 0.
Example 1:

[0,1,3,5,6,8,12,17]

There are a total of 8 stones.
The first stone at the 0th unit, second stone at the 1st unit,
third stone at the 3rd unit, and so on...
The last stone at the 17th unit.

Return true. The frog can jump to the last stone by jumping 
1 unit to the 2nd stone, then 2 units to the 3rd stone, then 
2 units to the 4th stone, then 3 units to the 6th stone, 
4 units to the 7th stone, and 5 units to the 8th stone.

their absolute difference is k.

Output: 2
Explanation: There are two 2-diff pairs in the array, (1, 3) and (3, 5).

Example 2:

### TEXT JUSTIFICATION ###
##########################
'''
Given an array of words and a width maxWidth, format the text such that 
each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. 
Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly maxWidth characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. 
If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, 
the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

### MERGE OVERLAPPING INTERVALS ###
###################################
'''
Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

Example 1:

Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]

Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].

Example 2:

Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]

Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

### PRODUCT EXCEPT SELF ###
###########################
'''
Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal 
to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

Example:

Input:  [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Constraint: It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of 
the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

Note: Please solve it without division and in O(n).

Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? 
(The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

Your algorithm's runtime complexity must be in the order of O(log n).
